The Netflix adaption of Shadow & Bone is finally here. It is definitely binge-watching worthy. I finished the show in one night (I wish I was kidding). I could not help but notice few changes in the show from the book series. Listed below are some of the major differences between the books and show.

## In the show, Alina is half shu

<!-- ![SOAP2DAY - Google Chrome 5_10_2021 6_47_15 PM.png](:/f0404f3ece304332babca11cab6cf366) -->

In the show from the first episode, Alina is treated badly because she looks like Shu, an enemy country to Ravka. Zoya refers to her as a half-breed. Whereas in the book series Alina's race is not specified. She is born on the border between Shu and Ravka. She is a skinny pale girl and is identified as an orphaned Ravakan.

From the beginning the showrunner Eric Heisserer and the book author Leigh Bardugo wanted Alina to be mixed race. By specifying her ethnicity they helped the audience understand that Alina did not feel like she belonged anywhere. She did not have that sense of belonging and that's why Grisha around her did not immediately accept her. Alina is been treated badly by her country and been referred to as an enemy, and it is the same girl who would be a savior of the same country who treated her unjustly. It certainly added more complexity to her character.

Jessica Mei Li who is half-white and half-Chinese is definitely the perfect person to play Alina Starkov. The actor also said that she could relate to Alina and the difficulties she faces for being mixed race.

## Alina and Mal are shown as far better friends than lovers in the show

<!-- ![xksJRVFDuDnPLfLYVqrkB6.jpg](:/f89b57f0ac404340809d1329ef0b528e) -->

Shadow and bone trilogy is written from Alina's point of view. From the start, it is clear that she is in love with him since they were teenagers. It is very obvious that she is crushing on him and constantly thinking about him. She admires his ability to make friends easily and fitting right in anywhere he goes, something she couldn't do easily. He seems oblivious about this at the start.

In the show, they are best friends, just like in books, but it is Mal who rather seems interested and has romantic feelings for her.

## Crows are here!!!

<!-- ![Shadow-and-Bone-The-Crows.jpg](:/f5c53657dac14cfea5ab5570bf17dd2d) -->

The early introduction of the crows in the show is one of the most significant changes from the book series. I was definitely excited to have my favorite characters introduced so early.

Those who only watched the show might not realize that some of the characters are from other book series in the Grishaverse. The title of the show is the same as that of the first book in the Shadow and Bone trilogy.

However, the members of the Crow Club- Kaz, Inej, and Jesper along with Nina and Matthais do not appear in the trilogy at all. These characters are not introduced until the standalone duology, Six of Crows and The Crooked Kingdom. Their adventures take place in the city of Ketterdam and a place which is yet to be visited in the show. The duology takes place two years after the events of the Shadow and bone trilogy.

Eric and his team, with the involvement of Leigh Bardugo, wrote an original storyline just for the show. Eric said multiple times that it can be considered as a prequel for the Crows (including Nina and Matthais). The show told the backstory of Crows as well.

Perhaps it is because of the involvement of the author herself but these characters felt authentic. Their personality and the troubles they face are pretty much the same in the book as well. The six of crows duology is one of the most popular series by Leigh. Many readers were excited about the crows being in the show from the start. I think it is fair to say that the readers were very happy with how authentic the characters were and with the storyline. I certainly was.

## Alexi met a different death from books

<!-- ![SOAP2DAY - Google Chrome 5_10_2021 7_10_10 PM.png](:/f030fda671954224b8ee3c5b070054bd) -->

Alexei was one of the most talented assistants. In the book, he gave Alina one of his assignments in exchange for information about The Darkling's coach that she had seen earlier. He was killed by a Volcra when the regiment tried to cross the Shadow Fold.

In the show, Alexi survives the Volcra by jumping off of the shift. The show weaves his story into that of Crows. He dies shortly after giving information on Sun Summoner.

## New characters

<!-- ![SOAP2DAY - Google Chrome 5_10_2021 6_55_50 PM.png](:/e8a7c8ecbe6a4240946bf7ee0b7bf609) -->

Arken Visser also known as the Conductor is an original character created just for the show. He is a smuggler who carried passengers back and forth from the fold. He even has a vehicle for it. He helps Crows cross the fold undetected and he plays an important role in the attempted plan to abduct Alina. None of this is mentioned in the books and it is a brand new storyline for the show.

Similarly, General Zlatan is a new character. He is the leader of the first army in East Ravka. He wants independence from the West Ravka and hence does not want to destroy the fold. He wants East Ravaka to be an independent nation. In the books, rather than his name, it is only mentioned that there is talk of an uprising in the west.

## General Kirigian's various names

<!-- ![the-black-heretic-shadow-and-bone-s1e4.jfif](:/147c84643e78402d8f8efc3faf065159) -->

In the book series, General Kirigian is referred to as the Darkling. Even Alina knows he is the Darkling right away. In the show, he is being referred to as General Kirigian and only Fjerdans seem to refer to him as the Darkling. This was done so the people who only watched the show don't get confused.

General Kirigian also reveals his name, Aleksander pretty early in the show. He just reveals it casually while getting his horse ready for a ride. This change is definitely a controversial one. Many readers were surprised by it. It is not until the third and final novel in Shadow and Bone trilogy, Ruin and Rising that he revealed his real name. In the book, he only reveals until Alina and he shares more intimacy and are more connected to each other. This change was definitely a bit upsetting for the readers since him revealing his real name was a big deal. Even Baghra was surprised that Alina knew her son's real name unlike in the show.

## Nina's Mission

<!-- ![SAB_Unit_03095RC.jpg](:/5e089e460db54f4b9d3e68f1b2a93605) -->

In the show, the Darkling sends Nina on a mission. Nina is Darkling's spy whereas in the book during the events of Shadow and Bone, Nina was just a student in the Little Palace.

In the books, Nina Zenik and her commander officer, Zoya Nazyalensky were sent on a mission to the Wandering Isles where Nina wanders into the Frejdan camps and gets captured.

It is shown as flashbacks in the book that Nina gets captured by the Drüskelle and taken in the ship. Nina and Matthais escape the ship wreckage and were struck together. They had to turn to each other to survive and finally in order to save Matthais from Grisha, Nina had to claimed that he was a slaver which leads to him be a prisoner of Hellgate.

These flashbacks occur a year after the event of the Shadow and bone. In the show, the storyline of Shadow and Bone and Six of Crows is combined and hence it occurs simultaneously.

## Let's talk about scars

<!-- ![SOAP2DAY - Google Chrome 5_10_2021 7_07_04 PM.png](:/2aa9d89fb9eb4a88857a75c44ff6d943) -->

In the show, Alina hurts herself by using a piece of broken pottery. She does this to trick the Grisha testers as she did not want to take the risk of being separated from Mal. Since she was already in pain, her Grisha powers were not revealed even when Grisha testers pricked her hand.

In books when Alina was 15 years old, she was waiting for Mal to return from a hunting trip. When he saw Alina, he picked her up in a big hug. Distracted by Mal and her fluttering heart, she forgot that she was holding a piece of broken pottery in her left hand and hence got the scar on the palm. It was on this day that Alina realized that she was in love with Mal and knew that everything changed. Even when she was hurt and convinced that Mal was ignoring her letters, she did not let Genya erase her scar.

"When he finally set me down and ambled off to the kitchen to find his lunch, I had stood there, my palm dripping blood, my head still spinning, knowing that everything had changed," Alina says in the book.

In the show, Mal gets a matching scar on his hand as well. Mal gets in a fight with the quartermaster and breaks a glass on his head since he said something to Alina. He hurts his hand doing so but of course, does not regret it even a bit. This flashback was not in the books.

But in the books rather than a scar on his hand, he gets it on his jaw. While tracking the Morzova's stag, Mal and his two friends get attacked by Fjerdans. Mal is the only one who survived and his two lifelong friends are killed. It is during this attack that he gets a scar.

## Elaborate Grisha show in the show

<!-- ![Alina_Ep5_Banner.jpg](:/6923ad853e82482dadcafa8c681f457b) -->

In the show, you can see Inferi and their great performances. Alina is also very confident in herself. When David, the great Fabikator offers her the gloves to split the light, Alina declines his offer. She can manage splitting of light on her own quite alright and of course, she gives an elaborate performance.

It is a small detail that readers might notice but in boks, Alina is quite nervous about the performance. To help her, mirrors were set throughout the room. Later David also her leather gloves lined with mirrors to help in the fight.

## Marie dies at the winter fete

<!-- ![Shadow-Bone-Marie-Death.png](:/8d8fe153054f4549966219e456bfb942) -->

In the show, Marie dies at the winter fete. Genya tailors Marie's face to look like Alina. She servers as Alina's decoy and later gets assassinated by the Conductor. It was also a really good way to show the extent of Genya's tailoring skills.

## Zoya is given more significance earlier

<!-- ![image (1).jfif](:/b6ff49e43fb2444cb3afe75de41de8c1) -->

Zoya Nazyalensky is given more significance earlier in the show than in books. In books, Zoya defeats the Darkling and takes Alina's side eventually but it is not shown not until the second book Siege and Storm. The slaughter of her aunt due to the expansion of the Fold being the reason to join Alina and to defeat the Darkling is the same in the books as well. But this is revealed in the second book.

Zoya is one of the most important characters in the books King of Scars and Rule of Wolves. The show's writers clearly want the audience to know that there is more of Zoya to come. Zoya is shown more significance earlier than in the books

## In the books, Alina knew about Morozava's stag

<!-- ![image.jfif](:/abf6badb657d4a15995ff6496b1a61d2) -->

In the books, the Darkling gives Alina information about amplifiers during their ride to the Little Palace. But in the show, the Appart gives her the information.

Darkling also tells her about the plan to hunt the Morozova's stag and to use it as amplifiers. But it is not until Baghra clues in that she realizes that Darkling was planning to use the amplifiers to control her. In the show, Alina is not sure why Darkling wants the stag.

## Darkling has a new fancy backstory

<!-- ![Ezsjp1IVgAIxnOy.png](:/f9884ac80f284d0c8641511d79bcd7f2) -->

In the books, we see only glimpses of Darkling's backstory from his mother, Baghra. As a kid, Darkling hated the dark and loved sunlight. He was told to hide his powers by his mother. Since always he wanted to make a safe place for Grisha where they wouldn't have to hide their powers as he did. It was his own ambition and lusting after power that caused Darkling to experiment with power and darkness which led to the creation of the Fold.

In the show, Darkling had a lover named Luda. She was a Grisha as well. Luda was killed by Ravkan man. At that time \Grisha \*were feared and they had to hide underground. Just like in the books Darkling wants a safe place for \*Grisha and wanted people to value their powers rather than being scared of them. But it was ultimately love that drove him to experiment with power. His new backstory is definitely much more sympathetic.

## Mal has a new personality

<!-- ![10441920.jpg](:/1839810c91d44c38b98584a56d60b788) -->

Mal is definitely far better in the show than in books. His personality has the greatest change from the book and for the better. Books are from Alina's point of view so it is cool that we got to see Mal's experience in the first army hunting the stag.

Many readers did not like Mal in the books. They rather Alina end up with Darkling or be alone than end up with Mal. Which is understandable because Mal is very passive-aggressive towards Alina. He gives her silent treatment. He is resentful and bitter. He is possessive of her and acts very jealous. Basically, he wants Alina to be the way she was before she found her powers. But he still loved Alina, he just was not able to express his feelings properly. In fact in the books, it was his suggestion to find the Morozava's stag.

In the show, Mal has a new personality and he is not toxic at all. He communicates well and he accepts Alina changing. He respects her and gives her space. He even says no to Zoya

In the book, Mal reacted extremely badly and childishly when he got to know about Alina's brief fling with the Darkling. He said, “He’s all over you.” He sneered at her saying "he owns you." Whereas in the show when Alina tries to explain what happened between Darkling and her, he simply says "You don't owe me any explanation. I just want to keep you safe." Like I said, definitely a big change in his personality and for the better.

## Big (and little) moments between Mal and Alina

<!-- ![Shadow-and-Bone-Alina-and-Mal-med-1024x682.jpg](:/c9f05e512e364cbc835919cc4d38669a) -->

We were denied many moments between Alina and Mal in the show. They share more intimacy in the books than in the show. During the hunt for Morozova's Stag, Summoning light was not enough to protect them from the cold so they had to cuddle quite often to not freeze (cliche but cute). Alina knew about Darkling's plan to control her and she made Mal promise to kill her before he let that happen. She didn't want the Darkling to control her or her powers.

Just moments before finding the Mrozava's stag, they also confessed about how much they missed each other. Alina admits she missed Mal every day. Mal said, “I missed you every hour. And do you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise”. In the show we see Alina tending to his wound and they only talked about not getting letters.

We were also denied one BIG moment between them. Just before Morozova's stag appears Mal kisses Alina for the very first time. Alina says in the book, “The moment our lips met, I knew with pure and piercing certainty that I would have waited for him forever."

I don't understand why the writers would change this. It was one of the biggest moments and one of my favorite moments in the book.

## Alina getting the stag's antlers as an amplifier is shown more gruesome and graphic in the show

<!-- ![tumblr_d54259377fc8c995b352175eb07ab781_ae0ef04b_1280.jpg](:/358833946f6a4000a4e524ea91cc4ef9) -->

In the show, Alina absorbs the antlers into her skin. David, the greatest Fabrikator, fuses them into her collar bone. He also fuses a piece of antler into Darkling's skin so that Darkling could be able to control Alina's powers.

In the books, the Darkling was able to control Alina's power since it was him who killed Morozova's stag. Also, the Darkling simply places two of the Stag's Antlers around Alina's throat, letting them rest on her collarbone. Then David simply fuses them together and hence Alina is struck with a collar. Which is far less blood and less graphic than in the show.
